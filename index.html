        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Spring Sandals is a developer's guide for building lightweight applications using the Spring Framework.
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
            We’ve seen many teams move away from Java and Spring in search of lighter-weight languages and frameworks - only
            to realize there’s no silver bullet. In response, we’re sharing a collection of examples of how Spring developers are adapting
            to this shift while continuing to take advantage of the framework’s strengths.
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
            The move often feels AI-driven, led by Python and libraries like Flask and BeautifulSoup. Developers then make attempts
            to revive the “good parts” of classic Java stacks in their new stack - only to find that building component-based architectures
            can be a real challenge in other languages and frameworks. To support this transition to AI, we’ve created an AI Discovery Agent
            project - built on top of the embedded-server template to demonstrate how Spring can still shine in this evolving landscape.
        <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem">Features</h4>
        <p>
            We have assembled a development toolchain that’s well-suited for both startups and enterprise teams. It’s built on modern,
            reliable technologies and designed to support fast, efficient development without unnecessary complexity.
        <ul>
            <li>Kotlin</li>
            <li>Spring</li>
            <li>Gradle</li>
            <li>Jetty</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL</li>
            <li>GitHub</li>
            <li>GitHub Actions for CI/CD</li>
            <li>Docker</li>
            <li>JetBrains IntelliJ</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
            And best of all, the toolchain runs lightning fast - whether you're developing locally or deploying to major cloud platforms.
        <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem">Architecture matters</h4>
        <p>
            We firmly believe that great applications are built by developers, for developers. The examples you'll find
            are filled with hard-earned insights and thoughtful design decisions, shaped by decades of
            experience; from single-purpose internal web apps to large-scale distributed systems supporting thousands of concurrent users.
            We
            hope you find these insights both refreshing and thought-provoking.

            If you're exploring ways to modernize your Spring applications or help your team grow their Spring expertise, we're always open
            to collaborating. We've worked with teams at various stages of this journey and are happy to share what we've learned. Feel free
            to reach out if a conversation would be helpful.
