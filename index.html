        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Spring Sandals is a developer's guide for building lightweight applications using Spring Framework.
        <p>
            We’ve seen many teams move away from Java and Spring in search of lighter-weight languages and frameworks,
            only
            to realize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">there’s no silver bullet</a>.
            In response, we maintain a collection of examples of how Spring developers can achieve the advantages of a
            light-weight framework
            while taking advantage Spring’s strengths.
        <p>
            The move often feels AI-driven, led by Python and libraries like Flask, BeautifulSoup, and LandChain.
            Developers then attempt to replicate the aspects of classic Java stacks in their new stack, only to find
            that building component-based architectures can be a real challenge in some languages and frameworks.
            To support this transition to AI, we’ve created the AI Discovery Agent project&mdash;built on top of the
            embedded-server template&mdash;to demonstrate how Spring continues to shine.
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <p>
            The development toolchain is well-suited for startups and enterprise teams.
            It’s built on modern, reliable technologies and designed to support fast, efficient development without
            unnecessary complexity.
        <ul>
            <li>Kotlin</li>
            <li>Spring</li>
            <li>Gradle</li>
            <li>Jetty</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL</li>
            <li>GitHub</li>
            <li>GitHub Actions for CI/CD</li>
            <li>Docker</li>
            <li>JetBrains IntelliJ</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Best of all, the toolchain runs lightning fast, whether you're developing locally or deploying to major
            cloud platforms.
        <h4>Architecture matters</h4>
        <p>
            Great applications are built by developers, for developers.
            Our example codebases are filled with hard-earned insights and thoughtful design decisions, shaped by
            decades of
            experience; from single-purpose internal web apps to large-scale distributed systems supporting thousands of
            concurrent users.
            We hope you find these insights both refreshing and thought-provoking.

            As you explore ways to modernize your Spring applications or to help your team build their Spring expertise,
            we're always open
            to collaborating. We've worked with teams at every stage of this journey and are happy to share what we've
            learned. Feel free
            to reach out if a conversation would be helpful.
